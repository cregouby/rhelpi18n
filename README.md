# Internationalisation of R help pages

This repository documents a proposal to support internationalisation of R help pages.

This project started at the 2023 R Project Sprint.
More [in this issue](https://github.com/r-devel/r-project-sprint-2023/issues/35).

## For users


Install this package:

``` r
pak::pak("eliocamp/rhelpi18n")
```

Next install a translation module. 
The [base.es](https://github.com/eliocamp/base.es) package hosts translations for `base::mean()` as an example, install it with

``` r
pak::pak("eliocamp/base.es")
```

### Initial experiment

Setting the LANGUAGE environmental variable to "es" will change your R language. 

```r
library(rhelpi18n)
Sys.setenv(LANGUAGE = "es")
```

Now `base::mean()`'s help page will be displayed in Spanish.

It will be the case for each and every packages if you have installed the relevant translation.

### Make it permanent 

If you love it, you don't want to remember to load the package name at every restart, 
so you can make it permanent through
```r
usethis::edit_r_profile()
```
and add the following line in your Rprofile (Work in progress)
```r
# added for {rhelp18n} to use local LANGUAGE for R help and and packages help
# library(rhelp18n)

```

This will work with the HTML documentation displayed by R GUIs like RStudio, as well as with text documentation displayed by R in the console. 

## For package developers

First get a copy of the package you want to translate. 

Choose your translation **language** by its [ISO 2-letter code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes) eventually with a regional option using underscore:

or example Spanish would be `language = "es"`, and Argentine Spanish would be `language = "es_AR"`.

Then use `rhelpi18n::i18n_module_create()` to create a **lang** translation **module** for that **package**


```r
rhelpi18n::i18n_module_create(module_name = "package.lang", 
                              language = "lang", 
                              module_path = "path/to/module", 
                              package_path = "path/to/package")
```

The translation string are saved into yaml files, one per Rd file of the original package.

You can find them in "path/to/module/translations" with this format:

```yaml
title:
  original: Title in the original language
  translation: ~
```
You can distribute them to your package translators.

After translation, replace the completed yaml files in the same folder.

Build the package and test. 

That's it.

## For package translators

In the received yaml files, replace the `~` in each `translation` field by the translation of the `original` field, like in the example: 

```yaml
title:
  original: Title in the original language
  translation: TÃ­tulo en la lengua original
```

**Problems**

1. It's not clear that the page is a translation and not the "official" one. 
2. It's not possible to access the original documentation without changing the LANGUAGE environmental variable and opening the help page again. 
3. There are some formatting issues, such as the `...` argument name.
